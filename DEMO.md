# VS Code

## Issue to PR

### Fixing Github Issue Bug

**Purpose**  
Demonstrate how you can use Amp to fix a bug from Issue to PR in one prompt

**Steps:**  
- There is a bug when sorting by "Fastest Delivery", duplicate items show up. Show this in the UI by going to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) and tell the a audience that you will now ask Amp to fix this Github issue.
- In VS Code or Terminal type
```
Fix bug https://github.com/sourcegraph/amp-demo/issues/16 in a new branch, test and validate changes, ci checks must all pass. Then create a pull request
```
- While Amp is executing you can optionally show a previous [thread](https://ampcode.com/threads/T-eb803356-f4a3-48f5-a7a7-5843a909a68d) that was run to fix this issue. Or you can switch to [_fix/duplicate-items-fastest-delivery_](https://github.com/sourcegraph/amp-demo/tree/fix/duplicate-items-fastest-delivery) branch locally and run this branch, which has the fix in case something goes wrong. 
- One its fixed the dropdown for category, shipping and sort by will be populated. And the the product list will change based on what is selected.

### Implementing a new feature

**Purpose**  
Demonstrate how you can Amp to Issue implement a new feature from issue to PR in one prompt

**Steps:**  
- The landing page is pretty bare bones. We want to create a carousel to highlight products and make it more interactive and responsive
- In VS Code or Terminal type
```
Implement feature https://github.com/sourcegraph/amp-demo/issues/4 in a new branch, test and validate changes, ci checks must all pass. Then create a pull request
```
- While Amp is executing you can optionally show a previous [thread](https://ampcode.com/threads/T-d37dc873-6b2d-4afe-b0be-a75b18a26aa5) that was run to for the feature. Or you can switch to [feature/landing-page-carousel](https://github.com/sourcegraph/amp-demo/tree/feature/landing-page-carousel) branch which has changes committed. 
- The end result is a new landing pag with a nice carousel as per screenshot below:

### PR review bot

**Purpose**  
Demonstrate Amp Github code review feature. 

**Steps:**  
- No manual action is required to execute the PR Review bot. The bot automatically runs whenever a pull request is created.
- In your issue to PR flow, create a pull request after pushing the branch to the main repo and show the Github PR bot working automatically.
- Example PR https://github.com/sourcegraph/amp-demo/pull/7 (Note, this isn't working atm. working on getting it fixed).

### Small change - Amp demo in <2 mins 

If you want to quickly demo Amp in under 2 mins, you can make a small change like changing the website background. Steps:
- Start the website using the command 'just up'. Show that website on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) has a white background and you will change it to light blue.
- Run this prompt ```Make the background light blue instead of white``` and Amp will upgrade the CSS to make background light blue.
- Restart the website; execute 'just down' then 'just up'.


## Oracle planning prompts

To demonstrate Oracle using this repo, run any of the provided prompts for the given use case. Make sure to mention the oracle to ensure o3 is reliably used.

Architecture Review:
```
Consult the oracle to review the current API architecture in the backend and suggest improvements for scalability. Focus on the database models, endpoint design, and error handling patterns.
```

Security Analysis:
```
Consult the oracle to analyze the authentication and authorization patterns in this e-commerce platform. Identify potential security vulnerabilities and recommend best practices for handling user data and payment processing.
```

Performance Planning:
```
Consult the oracle to plan an optimization strategy for this e-commerce platform to handle 10,000+ concurrent users. Consider database indexing, caching layers, and frontend performance.
```

Feature Planning:
```
Consult the oracle to plan the implementation of a real-time inventory management system that updates stock levels across the platform instantly when purchases are made.
```

Code Quality Review:
```
Consult the oracle to review the current testing strategy across backend and frontend. Analyze test coverage gaps and suggest improvements for better reliability.
```

Debugging Complex Issue:
```
There are intermittent race conditions in the order processing workflow when multiple users try to purchase the same item simultaneously. Consult the oracle to debug and plan a solution.
```


## Complex subagent change with Oracle

**Purpose**  
Demonstrate Amp's advanced capability of Amp leveraging Oracle and subagents. Right now the web app only displays one currency. We will instruct Amp to:
- Use Oracle to analyze what changes needs to be made to add support for multiple currencies
- Use subagents to run multiple changes simultaneously; Amp will make the backend and frontend changes in parallel, in addition to adding a new currency conversion service which comprises of a caching layers which refreshes currency in realtime (every 1 hour).

**Steps**  
- Start a new thread and invoke Oracle with the following prompt:
```
Use Oracle to evaluate how to add the following feature:

Add currency localization for international customer, the current default is USD $. 

Add GBP, EURO, AUD, Mexican Peso, Japanese Yen and auto populate the correct currency conversion based on latest FX rates.
```
- Once Amp evaluates the changes execute the following prompt
```
 Implement multi currency support using Oracle's suggestion using sub agents
```
- This execution will take a long time as its a fairly large change, key points; highlight the use of Amp using subagents to speed up execution, each subagent has its own context window and switch over to [this thread](https://ampcode.com/threads/T-5c2a0c8d-41cf-464f-9e33-acb0040634ec) where we these prompts were executed before to walk the user through the end result if you don't want to wait for 10 mins for the thread to finish executing.
- Alternatively, there is a [multiple-currency-conversion](https://github.com/sourcegraph/ecommerce-app/tree/multiple-currency-conversion) branch with the solution, you can switch over to this branch and show what the end result looks like. Essentially, you have option to select currency from a dropdown on the page:

## IDE diagnostics and testing
Amp will automatically read IDE diagnostics while implementing a feature or fixing a bug, you don't need to do any configuration here. Just tell the user that Amp reads IDE diagnostics and fixes issues/autocorrect any problems as they appear

<img width="648" height="529" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 at 11 56 52" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/793c1008-41ac-43c4-a734-8124e565c153" />

Similarly, Amp will do tests after making changest:
- Run local tests as part of the feature implementation/bug fix
- Do a screenshot via Playwright to validate changes and ensure that feature has been implemented as specified

## AGENTS.md / Multiple AGENTS.md

It is key to emphasize that Amp needs a good AGENTS.md file instructions for optimal performance. There are 3 different AGENTS.md file in this repo:
- Master [AGENTS.md file](https://github.com/sourcegraph/amp-demo/blob/main/AGENTS.md)
- [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/sourcegraph/amp-demo/blob/main/backend/AGENTS.md) file for backend
- [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/sourcegraph/amp-demo/blob/main/frontend/AGENTS.md) file for frontend

Study our guidance on how to write a [good AGENTS.md file](https://github.com/sourcegraph/amp-examples-and-guides/blob/main/guides/agent-file/Best_Practices.md) and convey the key points. Also review https://agents.md

Having hierarchial AGENTS.md structure is important for large monorepos, you can also show our own [Sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph) Repo to emphasize this point.


### MCP and tool calling

Amp can integrate with various MCP servers (remote and local), and leverage tool calling to execute commands. Amp ships with Playwright which lets it take screenshots of your browser. In the Issue to PR demo block above. Amp will validate changes using playwright and use Github CLI tool to create a pull request.

#### Users can add MCP servers in VS Code or the Amp CLI. 
- VS Code Amp plugin - to add/enable MCP servers, go to Amp settings in the IDE and enable Playwright. You can also add additional MCP servers via the settings page.
- Amp CLI - Use the example [settings.json file](../settings.json) 

Additionally, install the Github CLI from [here](https://cli.github.com) and set it up using your personal Github account. So that Amp can use tool calling ability to fetch Github issues, pull your code changes and create Pull Request on Github.

// TODO update this section to use with Sourcegraph MCP to demo Amp + Sourcegraph search

# Amp CLI in Terminal 

Amp can be executed in interactive mode by typing ```amp``` in terminal, or in non-interactive mode using -x command flag or piping input. 

## Amp in non-interactive mode

Execute the following commands, to show the audience that you can invoke Amp to run programatically or in a script. 
```
# Explain that we will cat package.json file and pipe the output to Amp and Amp will figure out which packages to update
cat package.json | amp -x "What dependencies need updating and why?"
```
## Amp in interactive mode

Before you start, copy [settings.json file](../settings.json) to ~/.config/amp/settings.json

Start Amp and execute the following prompt:
```Review the authentication system and refactor it to follow better security practices, ensuring all tests still pass```

Explain that we are going to refactor the authentication system in the Amp CLI GUI. 
Amp will figure out vulnerabilities, consult Oracle on how to fix and refactor code (as per screenshot).

[thread](https://ampcode.com/threads/T-47caa855-56e6-49a6-a1f6-703a5a584fd3)

This takes a while to execute so go to this [thread](https://ampcode.com/threads/T-47caa855-56e6-49a6-a1f6-703a5a584fd3) and walk the audience through the execution. 

### Thread management
While the thread is executing the the background, explain that users can manage multiple thread via CLI. Type ```amp threads``` to show all threads, then type ```amp --help``` to show the different thread subcommands:
```
  threads      [alias: t] Manage threads
    new        [alias: n] Create a new thread
    continue   [alias: c] Continue an existing thread
    fork       [alias: f] Fork an existing thread
    list       [alias: l] List all threads
    share      [alias: s] Share a thread
    compact    [alias: co] Compact a thread
```
Explain tthe different options, talk about:
- How you can continue an old thread ```amp t c <thread_ID>```
- Fork an existing thread and this will let you try out different approaches with Amp
- Compact a really large thread
- Set thread visibility. All threads are public by default unless 

### Slash commands
Type / command and talk the audience through different slash commands, put specail emphasis on /continue (resume old threads) and /queue (queue messages while a thread is executing).

**Custom /slash commands** 

Within the repo, there are a few custom slash commands execute any one of these custom commands in <repo>.agents/commands/ directory.. 

Hopefully, the thread we kicked off earlier would have finished executing by now. You can choose to execute either one of the custom commands to show how users can configure their own custom commands. Type ```amp``` in terminal to go into interactive mode and type ```/``` to invoke slash commands.
- ```/clean```: Command will clean up code base. Update deprecated usage, find dead code, improve code quality and etc. Explain that the command can be invoked to clean up code base on regular basis to avoid tech debt. See prior [thread execution here](https://ampcode.com/threads/T-55c288eb-319d-44dd-ab89-400e79a0bce4).
- ```/code-review-local```:  Command will do a local code review. A dev can execute this command before pushing changes upstream. See prior [thread here](https://ampcode.com/threads/T-e6546b2c-a8ae-489d-9132-3a7982fd4784).
```bash
# checkout the landing page carousel feature add and run a review on it
git checkout feature/landing-page-carousel
amp
/code-review-local
```
- ```/code-review```: Example code review command that could be executed on a PR in Github/Gitlab CI action.

### Amp shell
Amp shell is [ability](https://ampcode.com/news/through-the-agent-into-the-shell) to execute a command in interactive GUI.
1) Type amp and execute ```$just test local```
2) There may be test failures, in which case ask Amp to fix test failures. See this [thread for reference](https://ampcode.com/threads/T-ee9a2da8-0048-479d-8ecb-19edd94739cf).

# Intellij IDEA
Amp provides an IntelliJ plugin. When you run Amp in a terminal inside IntelliJ, it automatically installs the plugin. This allows Amp to communicate with IntelliJ via MCP, enabling it to access diagnostics data, see which files are open, and identify highlighted lines in the IDE.

Demonstrating IntelliJ is straightforward: start by running Amp in the terminal in Intellij, this will install the Amp plugin in In tellij
Then open the ecommerce-app project in IntelliJ. From there, 
- You can showcase the integration; highlight how Amp interacts with the IDE—and
- Run any of the prompts on this page (bug fix or feature improvment) to demonstrate Amp’s functionality within IntelliJ.
